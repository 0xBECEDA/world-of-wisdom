I choose hashcash algorithm, because of several reasons:

Historical Experience: HashCash was one of the first PoW algorithms proposed by Adam Back in 1997. It was successfully used to combat email spam and served as the foundational idea for creating later PoW algorithms, including Bitcoin. Its long history of use attests to its reliability.

Simplicity and Clarity: HashCash is a relatively simple algorithm, easily understood and implementable. This can be an important aspect, especially if the project aims to democratize mining and involve a wide community.

Scientific Community and Auditing: HashCash has been studied and audited by cryptographic experts and security researchers. This increases trust in its reliability
